# Compilation Fixes Required

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Test Project Dependencies Missing
Several test files reference missing packages and dependencies:
- **Moq**: Missing from test projects for mocking
- **FluentAssertions**: Missing from test projects
- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing**: Missing for integration tests
- **Infrastructure references**: Test projects can't reference Infrastructure layer

### 2. Missing Interface Implementations
- `ICalculatedCharacter` interface missing several required properties
- `CalculatedCharacter` concrete implementation missing
- `CharacterCalculator` class missing
- Repository interfaces missing method implementations

### 3. JavaScript Extensions Issues
- `IJSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync` extension methods missing
- Missing `Microsoft.JSInterop.Extensions` package references

### 4. CSS in Razor Components
- Media queries in `<style>` sections causing parser errors
- Need to move CSS to separate .css files or use proper @media syntax

### 5. Blazor Component Issues
- Hover card components have invalid CSS syntax
- SignalR components have binding conflicts

## Recommended Approach

Due to the extensive nature of these compilation errors (228 errors), I recommend:

1. **Focus on Core Functionality**: Comment out test projects temporarily to get main application compiling
2. **Fix Critical Runtime Issues**: Address missing interfaces and implementations
3. **CSS Cleanup**: Move embedded CSS to separate files
4. **Test Project Restoration**: Add missing NuGet packages and fix references

## Quick Fix to Get Application Running

1. Exclude test projects from build temporarily
2. Fix missing interfaces and core implementations  
3. Comment out broken Razor components temporarily
4. Get basic application launching

## Full Fix Plan

1. Add missing NuGet packages to test projects
2. Implement missing interfaces and classes
3. Fix CSS syntax issues in Razor components
4. Restore test functionality
5. Complete integration testing

Would you like me to proceed with the quick fix approach to get the application running first?
